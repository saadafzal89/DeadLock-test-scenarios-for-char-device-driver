1. There are total 5 userapp codes implmenting 4 deadlocks and 1 real deadlock.

2. The userapp has been implented by adding print statements and mutex locks in some places.

3. The driver code has not been modified except adding a few print statements to indicate the whereabouts of the processes within.

4. Upon a deadlock, the operating system needs to be restarted. Removing and re-inserting the device may not be sufficient and may cause irregular output as the counts may still hold the older values.

5. MAKEFILE for driver is included but does not compile the userapp codes.

6. Another file explaining the deadlock scenarios and race conditions is also included.
